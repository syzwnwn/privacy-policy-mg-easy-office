###Privacy Policy

Introduction
This Privacy Policy helps you understand what information we collect at MG EASY OFFICE, how we use it, and what choices you have. MG EASY OFFICE is developed and provided by Madani Group IT Solution as a free app to assist with internal staff attendance management.

MG EASY OFFICE is the official internal application developed exclusively for Madani Group to streamline and enhance daily office operations. Designed specifically to meet the organization’s internal workflow, this app functions as a centralized platform to improve efficiency, communication, and overall workplace convenience.

Through a secure and intuitive interface, MG EASY OFFICE enables staff to record their attendance via a photo-based check-in and check-out system. Users log in using their unique staff ID and password, which are sourced directly from the company’s SQL database — eliminating the need for in-app registration. Upon successful login, the app automatically redirects users to either the admin dashboard or staff dashboard, based on their roles.

For each check-in or check-out, staff are required to take a selfie and capture their current location. This attendance data is securely stored in Firebase and displayed in a detailed attendance log for easy tracking. Staff can view their individual attendance history, while admins are granted access to review all staff records, filterable by date or month.

Furthermore, the attendance data from Firebase is synchronized with the SQL database, ensuring centralized reporting and long-term storage. This enables the company to generate comprehensive attendance reports for HR or managerial analysis. A secure logout feature ensures user data remains protected at all times.

MG EASY OFFICE offers a reliable, transparent, and efficient solution for managing attendance across the organization — reinforcing professionalism, accountability, and punctuality within Madani Group.

Information Collection and Use
To provide this service effectively, we may require you to provide the following personally identifiable information:

Staff ID

Full name

Email address

Profile photo

Device location during check-in/out

Camera access for attendance selfies

Device ID and OS details

This information is securely stored and used strictly for attendance and reporting purposes.

The app may also use third-party services (e.g., Firebase, Google Maps) that collect data for analysis or service improvement.

Location Information
Location data is used only when a user performs a check-in or check-out action. It helps verify attendance and is not collected continuously.

Camera and Media Access
Camera access is required to take photos during check-in and check-out. These images serve as proof of presence and are stored securely in Firebase.

Device Information
We may collect non-personal device information (e.g., device model, OS version) for performance monitoring and security purposes. This helps prevent fraud and misuse of the system.

Cookies
This app does not use cookies directly. However, third-party services integrated into the app (e.g., Firebase, analytics tools) may use cookies to optimize performance. Users can manage cookie settings on their devices.

Service Providers
We may engage third-party services to:

Store and sync attendance data

Analyze usage trends

Deliver push notifications

Improve performance

These providers are bound by confidentiality agreements and are not allowed to use the information for unrelated purposes.

Security
We take user data seriously and use industry-standard security practices. While we strive to protect your information, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure. Users are encouraged to log out after use to maintain account security.

Children’s Privacy
This app is intended for use by Madani Group staff and is not designed for anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect data from minors. If a child’s data is found in our system, it will be promptly removed upon verification.
