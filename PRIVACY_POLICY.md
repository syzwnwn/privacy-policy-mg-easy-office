# Privacy Policy

## Introduction

This Privacy Policy helps you understand what information we collect at **MG EASY OFFICE**, how we use it, and what choices you have.

**MG EASY OFFICE** is developed and provided by **Madani Group IT Solution** as a free app to assist with internal staff attendance management. It is the official internal application developed exclusively for **Madani Group** to streamline and enhance daily office operations. Designed specifically to meet the organization’s internal workflow, this app functions as a centralized platform to improve efficiency, communication, and overall workplace convenience.

Through a secure and intuitive interface, **MG EASY OFFICE** enables staff to record their attendance via a **photo-based check-in and check-out system**. Users log in using their unique **staff ID and password**, which are sourced directly from the company’s **SQL database** — eliminating the need for in-app registration. Upon successful login, the app automatically redirects users to either the admin dashboard or staff dashboard, based on their roles.

For each check-in or check-out, staff are required to **take a selfie and capture their current location**. This attendance data is securely stored in **Firebase** and displayed in a detailed **attendance log** for easy tracking. Staff can view their individual attendance history, while admins are granted access to review all staff records, filterable by date or month.

Furthermore, the attendance data from Firebase is synchronized with the SQL database, ensuring **centralized reporting and long-term storage**. This enables the company to generate comprehensive attendance reports for HR or managerial analysis. A secure logout feature ensures user data remains protected at all times.

**MG EASY OFFICE** offers a reliable, transparent, and efficient solution for managing attendance across the organization — reinforcing professionalism, accountability, and punctuality within Madani Group.
